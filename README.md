# SEU_Algorithm-Design-and-Analysis-oj-Lab-Code

Southeast University algorithm design and analysis of the oj platform experimental questions code (part of the code generated by the GPT, part of the code refers to the online problem solving, part of the code from classmates)

Theoretically all the code is in one project, it's just divided into smaller projects by question number, there are _1 _2 etc. that are different versions of the same question, some of the versions are used for testing so they may not pass the oj.

The lack of code for all questions is due to the fact that our experiment did not require all questions to be done.
